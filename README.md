# What is this project?

This project is not mermaid.  

It just provides (hopefully) useful examples of mermaids use.  

Cool, just take me to [THE EXAMPLES](mermaid/the-examples.md)


# What is Mermaid?

From https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/

> Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.

> Diagramming and Documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly. But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.
