# What is this project?

This project is not mermaid.  

It just provides a collection of curated mermaid examples, sourced online or just made up.  

It will also include references to UML modelling too resources online.  

You should definitely checkout out the [mermaid-js syntax docs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) as they are comprehensive.  However, it doesn't include stuff like "how to" use UML properly.

Cool, just take me to [THE EXAMPLES](/mermaid/the-examples.md)


# What is Mermaid?

From https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/

> Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.

> Diagramming and Documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly. But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.

# Rendering Mermaid

Mermaid can be rendered in a number of ways.  

This project uses markdown rendering.  

vsode rendering: You can use a vscode plugin to preview the markdown with rendered models.  

github rendering: Currently (jun 2021), github does not render mermaid inside markdown ([boo, hiss](https://github.community/t/feature-request-support-mermaid-markdown-graph-diagrams-in-md-files/1922)).
