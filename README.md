This project is in draft.

# What is this project?

This project is not mermaid.  

It just provides a collection of curated mermaid examples, sourced online or just made up.  

It will also include references to UML modelling too resources online.  

You should definitely checkout out the [mermaid-js syntax docs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) as they are comprehensive.  However, it doesn't include stuff like "how to" use UML properly.

Cool, just take me to [THE EXAMPLES](mermaid/the-examples.md)


# What is Mermaid?

From https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/

> Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.

> Diagramming and Documentation costs precious developer time and gets outdated quickly. But not having diagrams or docs ruins productivity and hurts organizational learning.
